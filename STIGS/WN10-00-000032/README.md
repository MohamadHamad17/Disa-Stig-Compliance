## 📋 STIG Quick Facts

| Field            | Value                                                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **STIG ID**      | WN10-00-000032                                         |
| **Category**     | BitLocker Encryption                                   |
| **Requirement**  | Configure BitLocker to use a PIN with a minimum length of 6 characters |
| **Severity**     | Medium                                                 |
| **Why it matters** | Short PINs are easier to guess or brute-force. A longer PIN better protects data on encrypted drives if the device is lost or stolen. |

## 🔍 How to Check the Current Setting

1. Press **Windows + R**, type `gpedit.msc`, and press **Enter**.  
2. Browse to:

   ```text
   Computer Configuration
   └── Administrative Templates
       └── Windows Components
           └── BitLocker Drive Encryption
               └── Operating System Drives

3. In the right-hand pane, locate Configure minimum PIN length for startup.
4. If the policy is Not Configured or Enabled with a value less than 6, the system is non-compliant.

## ✅ Solution: Enforce Minimum BitLocker PIN Length via Group Policy

### 📍 Policy Path
```text
Computer Configuration
└── Administrative Templates
    └── Windows Components
        └── BitLocker Drive Encryption
            └── Operating System Drives
                └── Configure minimum PIN length for startup
```
